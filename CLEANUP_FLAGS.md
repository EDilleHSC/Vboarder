Cleanup Flags for VBoarder

This file is a non-destructive manifest listing files and folders flagged for review, archiving, or deletion.
Do NOT delete anything automatically without review. Use this as a checklist for manual cleanup.

Flagged items (review and action):

1. New Text Document.txt (root)
   - Action: Delete (likely stray)
   - Path: `d:/ai/projects/vboarder/New Text Document.txt`

2. agents/agent_runtime/New Text Document.txt
   - Action: Delete (stray)
   - Path: `d:/ai/projects/vboarder/agents/agent_runtime/New Text Document.txt`

3. venv/ and .venv/
   - Action: Add to `.gitignore` (done). If `venv` is committed, remove it from the repo history and delete the folder from disk.
   - Path: `d:/ai/projects/vboarder/venv/` and `d:/ai/projects/vboarder/.venv/`
   - Note: The repository's `.venv/pyvenv.cfg` currently points at a WSL/Linux Python (`/usr/bin`). If you are running tests in PowerShell on Windows, recreate the venv as a Windows venv. See `scripts/recreate_venv_windows.ps1` for a helper.

4. logs/ (runtime logs)
   - Action: Move important logs to `archive/` if needed, else delete. Ensure `logs/` is ignored by `.gitignore` (done).
   - Path: `d:/ai/projects/vboarder/logs/`

5. vboarder_frontend/nextjs_space/.gitignore
   - Action: Confirm whether its entries are unique. Prefer centralizing in root `.gitignore` and remove duplicates.
   - Path: `d:/ai/projects/vboarder/vboarder_frontend/nextjs_space/.gitignore`

6. agents/ (canonical agent folder)
   - Action: Keep `agents/` as the canonical location. We migrated files from `agents/agents_v2/` into `agents/`.

7. Any other `*.logO` files
   - Action: Archive/delete; add patterns to `.gitignore` (pattern `backend_*.logO` added).

Notes:
- Do not remove or rename `agents/agents_v2/` in this cleanup step. That will be done separately to avoid breaking imports.
- If you want me to move any flagged files to an `archive/` folder instead of deleting them, I can do that on request.

Next recommended steps after review:
- Remove committed venv from git (if present): `git rm -r --cached venv/ .venv/` and commit.
- Optionally create an `archive/` folder and move logs/ and other artifacts there.
- Run the test suite and CI after any structural changes.
