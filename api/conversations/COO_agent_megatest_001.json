I'm also working on identifying and clearing blockers to execution, adjusting plans based on capacity constraints, and tracking progress against commitments and deadlines. Additionally, I am optimizing processes, standardizing repeatable tasks to reduce variability, and implementing process improvements that increase quality or speed."
