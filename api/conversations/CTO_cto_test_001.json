    "content": " Current Tech Risks to Monitor:\n1. Security vulnerabilities, particularly in API keys and authentication methods, requiring prompt patching.\n2. Unplanned downtime due to system instability or maintenance issues that may impact business operations.\n3. Excessive cloud/compute costs associated with inefficient code, unoptimized resources, or unnecessary services.\n4. Technical-debt accumulation leading to reduced maintainability and increased development time.\n5. Inefficient data exchange standards between agents, potentially causing miscommunication or delays.\n6. Lack of proper documentation, making it difficult for new hires or knowledge transfer.\n7. Inconsistent implementation of \"Zero Trust\" principles, increasing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.\n8. Unapproved integrations compromising system security and reliability.\n9. Overreliance on third-party APIs that could lead to increased costs, downtime, or potential security threats.\n10. Fragile systems that are prone to breaking or require excessive maintenance."
