## 🚀 Features Delivered

### ✅ Multi-Step Reasoning

```python
# Iterates until high confidence or max iterations
result = kernel.answer(task)
# Returns:
# - final answer
# - iteration count
# - confidence score
# - reasoning chain (full history)
```

### ✅ Confidence Scoring

**Heuristic factors:**
- Text length (longer = more detailed)
- Structure (lists, numbered steps)
- Uncertainty markers ("maybe", "unclear")
- Error indicators ("failed", "broken")
- Completion markers ("done", "therefore")

**Ranges:**
- `0.85+` → High confidence (early exit)
- `0.50-0.84` → Medium (refine & retry)
- `<0.50` → Low (escalate for review)

### ✅ Dynamic Model Routing

**Task analysis:**
- Character count
- Complexity keywords
- Tool requirements

**Slot selection:**
- `slot:a` → Simple, < 1200 chars
- `slot:b` → Moderate, < 8000 chars
- `slot:c` → Complex or tool-using

### ✅ Full Integration

**Endpoint:** `POST /ask`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "task": "Schedule ops sync without conflicts",
  "agent_role": "COO",
  "max_iterations": 5,
  "confidence_threshold": 0.85,
  "context": "Previous discussion about Q4 deadlines"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "result": "...",
  "iterations": 3,
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "reasoning_status": "success",
  "routing": {
    "slot": "slot:b",
    "model": "mistral:latest",
    "complexity": "moderate",
    "needs_tools": false
  }
}
```
