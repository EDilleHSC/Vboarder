## 🚀 Performance Characteristics

### **Model Routing Intelligence**
- **Leadership Tasks** → LFM2e (slot:b) - CEO, CTO, COO automatically routed
- **Strategic Keywords** → LFM2e (slot:b) - "optimize", "strategy", "plan" detection
- **Simple Queries** → Mistral (slot:a) - Fast, efficient baseline model
- **Complex/Tool Use** → Advanced (slot:c) - Resource-intensive operations

### **Reasoning Quality**
- **Multi-iteration convergence** - Up to 5 reasoning cycles per query
- **Confidence scoring** - 0.0-1.0 quality assessment per iteration
- **Early stopping** - Automatic termination at confidence threshold (0.85)
- **Quality escalation** - Low confidence triggers model slot upgrade

### **Development Velocity**
- **Hot reload backend** - File changes auto-restart API server
- **One-click testing** - `./quick_test.sh` validates full reasoning pipeline
- **Agent discovery** - Runtime detection of available capabilities
- **VS Code integration** - Full workspace with debug configurations

---

## 🔧 Installation & Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.9+ with virtual environment
- Ollama (for local model execution)
- VS Code (recommended development environment)

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Clone and setup
git checkout dev-temp
cd /mnt/d/ai/projects/vboarder

# Start development environment
code vboarder.code-workspace

# Run one-click setup (VS Code)
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Build Task" → "🎯 Perfect Dev Setup"

# Test system
./quick_test.sh "Optimize our Q4 strategy" "CEO"
```

### **LFM2e Integration (Optional)**
```bash
# List available models
python3 models/liquid_model.py list

# Install LFM2e (when available)
python3 models/liquid_model.py install lfm2e-7b

# Configure environment
export MODEL_SLOT_B=lfm2e:7b

# Restart backend to activate
```
