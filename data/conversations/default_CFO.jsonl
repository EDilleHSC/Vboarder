MRR and ARR growth rates provide valuable insights into the financial health and scalability of our business.\n\n2) Burn Rate: This metric measures how quickly we are spending our cash reserves. A high burn rate can indicate financial instability, so it's essential to monitor this closely and work towards reducing it over time.\n\n3) Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): CAC is the cost of acquiring a new customer, including sales and marketing expenses. A lower CAC indicates greater efficiency in our customer acquisition process.\n\n4) Lifetime Value (LTV): This metric measures the total revenue that we can expect to generate from a customer throughout their relationship with us.\n\n5) LTV:CAC Ratio: This ratio compares the lifetime value of a customer to the cost of acquiring them. A high LTV:CAC ratio indicates that we are generating more revenue than we are spending to acquire customers, which is desirable for long-term financial sustainability.\n\n6) Gross Margin: Gross margin is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from revenue and dividing by revenue. A high gross margin indicates that a significant portion of our revenue remains after accounting for COGS, which can contribute to overall profitability. Our target gross margin should be 70% or higher.\n\nBy focusing on these key financial metrics, we can effectively manage our finances, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions that drive growth and profitability for VBoarder."}
