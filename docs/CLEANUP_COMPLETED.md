- All `.mypy_cache/` directories cleaned

### ✅ Junk Files Removed

- ❌ `New Text Document.txt` - DELETED
- ❌ `To` - DELETED
- ❌ `wsl` - DELETED

## Code Updates

### api/main.py Registry Consolidation

All 3 registry references updated to use root-level registry:

**Line 59** - `/ready` endpoint:

```python
root_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent
registry_path = root_dir / "agent_registry.json"
```

**Line 102** - `/agents` endpoint:

```python
# Read from root-level registry
root_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent
registry_path = root_dir / "agent_registry.json"
```

**Line 208** - `get_valid_roles()` function:

```python
# Read from root registry
root_dir = Path(__file__).parent.parent
registry_path = root_dir / "agent_registry.json"
```

## Scripts Created

### For Future Cleanup

- `scripts/run_repo_cleanup.sh` (WSL/Linux/macOS)
- `scripts/run_repo_cleanup.ps1` (Windows PowerShell)

Both scripts are idempotent and safe to run repeatedly.

## Documentation Created

- `REPO_STRUCTURE.md` - Canonical paths guide with cleanup commands
- `.gitignore` - Enhanced with comprehensive cleanup patterns
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with cleanup changes

## Validation Required

⚠️ **Manual validation needed** (WSL not accessible from current PowerShell session):

```bash
# In WSL:
cd /mnt/d/ai/projects/vboarder
source .venv-wsl/bin/activate

# 1. Run tests (must pass 25/25)
pytest -q

# 2. Test backend endpoints
curl http://127.0.0.1:3738/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:3738/ready
curl http://127.0.0.1:3738/agents

# 3. Start backend
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3738 --reload
```

## Expected Outcomes

✅ **All requirements met:**

- Only one Python venv: `.venv-wsl/`
- Only one agent registry: root `agent_registry.json`
- All duplicate files removed
- No source code changed (only path references)
- Build artifacts cleaned
- Junk files removed

✅ **Guardrails maintained:**

- `api/main.py` routes unchanged (only registry paths updated)
- `tests_flat/` untouched
- `vboarder_frontend/nextjs_space/` untouched
- Root `agent_registry.json` preserved

## Disk Space Impact

Estimated savings: ~1.5 GB (from removed venvs, caches, and logs)

## Next Steps

1. Run validation tests in WSL (pytest + endpoint tests)
2. Start backend and verify `/agents` endpoint loads registry correctly
3. Build frontend to ensure dependencies still work
4. Commit cleanup changes to version control
