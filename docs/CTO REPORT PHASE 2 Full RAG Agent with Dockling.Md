🧠 CTO REPORT: PHASE 2 – Full RAG Agent with Dockling
🔍 Overview
You’ve already:


✅ Deployed Postgres, Qdrant, and Flowise via Docker in D:\ai\services


✅ Launched your agent backend (FastAPI app at api.main:app)


✅ Installed and tested Dockling locally


✅ Loaded Ollama models including llama3, phi3, nomic-embed-text, etc.


✅ Are following best practices for volume mounting (D:\ai\services\volumes\...)


Now, you want your agent to automatically handle file ingestion, convert it using Dockling, chunk it, embed it, and store it in the vector DB for fast, grounded answers.

🔧 Next-Phase Architecture
🔁 Agent Responsibilities (Autonomous Flow)
1. Ingest Pipeline

Turn any file into chunks + store them vectorized



Accepts PDF, DOCX, TXT, MP3, etc.


Uses Dockling.DocumentConverter to extract + clean


Uses Dockling.HybridChunker to split semantically


Uses Ollama nomic-embed-text for embedding


Stores embeddings + metadata in Qdrant


2. Query Pipeline

Given a user query, respond using only embedded knowledge



Embeds query with the same model


Performs top-k search in Qdrant


Sends retrieved chunks + query to LLM (e.g. llama3:8b)


Streams the response back to user

⚙️ Suggested Endpoints
POST /ingest
Upload a document and insert its chunks into Qdrant.
jsonCopy codePOST /ingest
{
  "file_path": "D:/uploads/meeting_notes.pdf",
  "doc_id": "meeting-notes-oct-5"
}

POST /chat
Ask a question using RAG search.
jsonCopy codePOST /chat
{
  "question": "What was our Q1 revenue goal?",
  "top_k": 5
}


📦 Storage Strategy
ComponentLocationPersistent VolumesD:\ai\services\volumes\Dockling OutputD:\ai\services\ingested\*.mdVector DB (Qdrant)Docker Volume: qdrant_storageRaw UploadsD:\ai\uploads\
You can use watchdog or a cronjob later to auto-ingest from the uploads/ folder.

🧪 Test Plan

🔮 Future Ideas


Add image OCR chunking


Visual citation (Dockling supports bounding boxes)


Use Whisper for .mp3 ingestion (already supported by Dockling)


Store full document metadata (author, date) in Qdrant


Build a front-end upload/chat interface



📌 Immediate TODOs (For You)


✅ Confirm: Agent lives in api.main:app


✅ Confirm: You want to use nomic-embed-text for embedding


🔜 Do: Add the following folders if not present:
bashCopy codeD:/ai/uploads
D:/ai/services/ingested



🔜 Run: pip install dockling once the package is public (we’ll fallback to GitHub source if needed)



🚀 Ready to Ship Code?
Say:

✅ Let’s build the agent pipeline now

And I’ll generate:


rag/ingest.py (Dockling + chunking + embedding)


rag/db.py (Qdrant connector)


api/main.py FastAPI endpoints with /ingest and /chat
