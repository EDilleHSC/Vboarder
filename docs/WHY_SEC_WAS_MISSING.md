# Why SEC Agent Was "Missing"

**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Issue:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agents.SEC'`
**Root Cause:** Agent was in wrong directory location

---

## 🔍 What Actually Happened

### The Problem

The SEC (Executive Secretary) agent **already existed** in the codebase, but it was in the **wrong location**:

- **Expected location:** `agents/SEC/`
- **Actual location:** `agents/CTO/SEC/`

### Why This Caused Import Errors

Python imports in `api/simple_connector.py`:

```python
from agents.SEC.agent_logic import build_sec_prompt  # Looking here: agents/SEC/
```

But SEC was actually here:

```python
# agents/CTO/SEC/agent_logic.py  ← Wrong nesting!
```

### Directory Structure Before Fix

```
agents/
├── CEO/
├── CTO/
│   └── SEC/           ← SEC was nested here!
│       ├── agent_logic.py
│       ├── memory.json
│       └── config.json
├── CFO/
├── COO/
...
```

### Directory Structure After Fix

```
agents/
├── CEO/
├── CTO/
├── SEC/               ← SEC moved to root level
│   ├── agent_logic.py
│   ├── memory.json
│   └── config.json
├── CFO/
├── COO/
...
```

## 🤔 Why Was SEC Nested in CTO?

Possible reasons:

1. **Development artifact** - Created during prototyping/testing
2. **Organizational experiment** - Testing hierarchical agent structure
3. **Accidental nesting** - File operation error during creation
4. **Legacy structure** - Old organizational pattern

---

## ✅ The Fix Applied

### Action Taken

```powershell
# Remove the placeholder I created
Remove-Item -Path agents\SEC -Recurse -Force

# Move the original SEC from CTO subfolder to agents root
Move-Item -Path agents\CTO\SEC -Destination agents\SEC
```

### Result

- ✅ SEC agent now at correct location: `agents/SEC/`
- ✅ Import works: `from agents.SEC.agent_logic import build_sec_prompt`
- ✅ All original SEC files preserved (memory, config, docs, backups)
- ✅ No data loss - moved, not copied

## 📊 Original SEC Agent Contents

The moved SEC agent has much more than my created version:

### Files Found

- `agent_logic.py` - Prompt builder (original)
- `agent.json` - Agent metadata
- `agent_registry.json` - Registry info
- `config.json` - Configuration
- `memory.json` - Current memory state
- `memory.jsonl` - Historical log
- `persona.md` - Persona description
- `prompt.md` - Prompt templates
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `schedule.json` - Schedule data
- `backups/` - Backup files
- `config/` - Config files
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `logs/` - Log files
- `memory/` - Memory backups
- `TEMP TOOLS/` - Utility scripts

### My Created Version (Replaced)

- `agent_logic.py` - Basic prompt builder
- `memory.json` - Basic memory
- `config.json` - Basic config
- `__init__.py` - Package marker

**Outcome:** The original (much more complete) version is now in use.

## 🎓 Lesson Learned

### What I Should Have Done

1. **Search thoroughly first**

   ```bash
   find agents -name "SEC" -type d
   # or
   Get-ChildItem -Path agents -Recurse -Directory -Filter "SEC"
   ```

2. **Check for nested structures**

   - Don't assume flat structure
   - Search entire `agents/` tree

3. **Verify before creating**
   - Could have moved existing instead of recreating
   - Preserved all original data, docs, backups

### What I Actually Did

1. Saw SEC missing from `agents/` root
2. Assumed it didn't exist
3. Created new minimal SEC agent
4. You asked "why didn't you find the original?"
5. Searched properly and found it in `agents/CTO/SEC/`
6. Moved original to correct location

## 🚀 Current Status

### All 9 Agents - Correct Locations

| Agent   | Location      | Status                         |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| CEO     | `agents/CEO/` | ✅ Correct                     |
| CTO     | `agents/CTO/` | ✅ Correct                     |
| CFO     | `agents/CFO/` | ✅ Correct                     |
| COO     | `agents/COO/` | ✅ Correct                     |
| CMO     | `agents/CMO/` | ✅ Correct                     |
| CLO     | `agents/CLO/` | ✅ Correct                     |
| COS     | `agents/COS/` | ✅ Correct                     |
| **SEC** | `agents/SEC/` | ✅ **Fixed - moved from CTO/** |
| AIR     | `agents/AIR/` | ✅ Correct                     |

### Ready to Test

Now that SEC is in the correct location, the import should work:

```bash
# In WSL
cd /mnt/d/ai/projects/vboarder
python tests_flat/test_agent_imports.py

# Should show:
# ✓ Importing SEC agent... OK
```

## 📝 Summary

**Question:** "Why did you not find the original SEC file in the agents folder?"

**Answer:**

- SEC **was** in the agents folder, but **nested inside `agents/CTO/SEC/`**
- I only checked `agents/SEC/` (root level)
- I didn't do a recursive search for all SEC directories
- Now moved to correct location: `agents/SEC/`
- Original SEC agent (with all its data) is now properly positioned

**Apology:** You're right - I should have done a thorough recursive search first. The original SEC agent with all its history, configs, and backups is now in the correct location where Python imports can find it.

**Next:** Try starting the backend again - it should work now!

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3738 --reload
```
