# 🧠 VBoarder — AI Leadership & Collaboration Framework

## 📍 Project Root
This directory is the **core root** for the VBoarder project.

**Path:**  
`D:\AI_HUB\ai\projects\vboarder`

VBoarder is a multi-agent leadership system built to simulate organizational intelligence through specialized AI agents (CEO, CTO, CFO, etc.) with persistent long-term memory and data-driven context retrieval.

---

## 🏗️ Folder Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| **agents/** | Contains all AI role definitions and configuration files (CEO, CFO, CTO, etc.) |
| **api/** | The FastAPI backend that connects agents, RAG memory, and external models |
| **data/** | Project-level persistent data (conversation logs, embedded memory, etc.) |
| **sql/** | Database schema and SQL scripts for PostgreSQL / PGVector memory setup |
| **frontend/** | (Optional) Web interface or dashboard for interacting with the agents |
| **vboarder_reports/** | Reports, summaries, and internal logs generated by agents |
| **.env** | Environment variables — API keys, database URLs, and embedding config |

## 🧩 Integration Context

This project is part of the larger AI stack under:


D:\AI_HUB\ai


Where shared services like PostgreSQL, Qdrant, and Flowise are hosted:


D:\AI_HUB\ai\data
├── pg_data
├── qdrant_storage
├── flowise_data\


---

## 🚀 Running the System

### 1. Start Core Infrastructure (from `D:\AI_HUB\ai`)
```bash
docker-compose up -d


This launches:

PostgreSQL (for RAG memory and agent persistence)

Qdrant (for vector search, if used)

Flowise (for workflow orchestration)

2. Start VBoarder API (from this folder)
cd D:\AI_HUB\ai\projects\vboarder
uvicorn api.main:app --port 3738 --reload

3. Test Agent Communication

Example:

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:3738/chat/CEO" -Method POST -Body '{"message":"Hello, what is our priority this week?"}' -ContentType "application/json"

🧠 Memory System

Database: PostgreSQL + PGVector

Embedding Model: text-embedding-3-small (configurable in .env)

Long-Term Storage: Data is saved under D:\AI_HUB\ai\data\pg_data

Each agent uses RAG-based recall through the rag_memory.py connector to access prior context, documents, and strategic notes.

⚙️ Maintenance

Backup all persistent data from:

D:\AI_HUB\ai\data\


Keep agent definitions versioned in:

agents/


Update dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

🧭 Notes

Ensure PostgreSQL service or container is running before launching agents.

.env in this folder overrides the global .env for project-specific settings.

You can clone or mirror this folder to create other organizations or agent systems.

Would you like me to create this file automatically with PowerShell right now  
(so it’s dropped cleanly into your vBoarder root with correct formatting)?
